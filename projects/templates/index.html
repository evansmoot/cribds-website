    <p class="lead">The Cameroonian Refugee Project is a project designed to help support displaced Cameroonians citizens. Through this project Cameroonian refugees will be able to publish projects to the world and potentially gain funding. Our goal is to help fractured communities become whole communities and to help refugees support themselves and others during this crisis. As a donor you will be connected with projects and individuals that you've funded, so you can stay updated on the progress of the project. Help us in our goal of building these refugee camps into communities and become a donor today!
