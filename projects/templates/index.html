    <p class="lead"><b>The Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia Refugee Project is designed to help support displaced Southern Cameroonian refugees fleeing the genocide inflicted on them by the brutal forces of La Republique du Cameroun. Through this project Southern Cameroonian refugees will be able to start small businesses with the help of well wishers across the world willing to help fund the projects.</b>
      <p class="lead"><b>Our goal is to support displaced and fractured communities by helping the refugees support themselves and others during this crisis. As a donor you will be connected with projects and individuals that you've funded, so you can stay updated on the progress of the project. Help us achieve our goal of making these refugees independent by starting sustainable small businesses in order to take care of themselves and their families, rather than relying on handouts.</b>
